        <p class="postText">Intuition is fucking important. Learn from fucking criticism. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. The graphic designer’s first fucking consideration is always the size and shape of the format, whether for the printed page or for digital display. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act involves this element of ‘newness’ and ‘experimentalism,’ then one must expect and accept the fucking possibility of failure. Dedicate yourself to lifelong fucking learning. Nothing of value comes to you without fucking working at it. Use your fucking hands. Your rapidograph pens are fucking dried up, the x-acto blades in your bag are rusty, and your mind is dull. Stop clicking your mouse, get messy, go back to the basics and make something fucking original. Respect your fucking craft. You need to sit down and sketch more fucking ideas because stalking your ex on facebook isn’t going to get you anywhere. Design is all about fucking relationships&mdash;the relationship of form and content, the relationship of elements, the relationship  of designer and user. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. Widows and orphans are terrible fucking tragedies, both in real life and definitely in typography. If you’re not being fucking honest with yourself how could you ever hope to communicate something meaningful to someone else? Make your work consistent but not fucking predictable. You won’t get good at anything by doing it a lot fucking aimlessly. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, &ldquo;When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.&rdquo; Fuck. To go partway is easy, but mastering anything requires hard fucking work. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. Practice won’t get you anywhere if you mindlessly fucking practice the same thing. Change only occurs when you work deliberately with purpose toward a goal. You are not your fucking work. Don’t fucking lie to yourself. The details are not the details. They make the fucking design. Sometimes it is appropriate to place various </p>
